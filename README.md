Project Cinema group B (Tidaholm)


* Daily Scrum @ Discord 15.00
* English only @ Github
* English only @ comments in code
* Swedish is okej in other communication 
* At least one (someone else) reviews PR. The same person can merge and the same person can test!
* For each card you put in Code review, you must review a card!
* Never write in .CSS directly BUT ok to write vanilla CSS in the SASS file
* Unique branch for each PBI
* Use rem (relative measurements instead of px on e.g. fontsize).
